# Session 1 Materials covered

Today we went over a quick overview of everything in the course content, and
an overview of dev tools and some tips and tricks

## Vscode

### Extensions

- Auto close tags -> automatically close html tags
- Auto rename tags -> when changing one tag, changes the closing tag as well so we don' t need to do it
- css peek -> peek at css code in html
- html hint -> gives you hints in html if you have an error
- Intellisense for css -> gives suggestions based on your css file, like auto filling css class names and so on
- live-server -> starts up your site locally
- material Icon theme -> display icons next to file names to let you know what file types you have
- prettier -> automatically format your files on save so that it looks clean and organized
- RainGlow -> change how vscode looks if you don't like the default color theme

## Google dev tools

- ctrl + shift + c -> opens inspect tools
- you can view the html file in _inspect_, and if you hover over an element you can see it being highlighted in your browser
- Network is a great way to measure your sites performance, simply go to network tab and reload the page
- Rules is a great place to check to make sure your css is working or not.
  - if an element is crossed out, it means one of two things: 1. its been changed later in the file 2. there is an error
  - view element properties and sizes
  - on the right side of an element you can see from which file the css is from
- layout is the place to go if you want to see how your flex box, grid or basic margin and padding is working.
- if you click on the phone icon on the top right, you can chenge the screen size to see how your site looks on different screens
