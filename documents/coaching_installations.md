# Tools installed

## Brew

you can use this to install and update applications!
to use: `brew install <name>` where name is the name of the application

## neofetch

This is the robot on the screen, I have mine on the buttom left side of the screen!
to open, I have set it to use alt + a (make sure you have .zshrc I had sent from before)

## Ghostty

this is the _terminal_ we use, you can do a lot here!
I use it for editing text, note taking, writing code, checking on my system resource, and so on!

## Btop

this is a great terminal program that lets you see what is going on in your computer.
you can use this to check your system usage (cpu, gpu, ram, wifi, etc) and battery status
you can also use this to close applications if they are having issues.

by pressing on <Esc> key, you can go to options and change the color configuration by going to option!

## Nvim

this is an advanced text editor, so it will be a bit **tough** to use in the beginning.
nvim has three modes:

- `normal` -> this mode is used to move around your document
- `insert` -> this part is simple, its like your normal text editor! you can type your texts here!
- `visual` -> you can use this mode to select text to delete, copy, and so on!

### Some useful shortcuts

> [!TIP]
> if you see leader key being mentioned, it means space bar

- use j,k,l,h for going up, down, left, right
- use i for insert mode, esc to go out of it and go to normal mode, and v for visual mode
- leader + e -> open a file explorer
- ; + f -> open search for files
- gg goes to top of doc, G goes to bottom

## fzf

this is a search tool in the terminal, you can use it to look for files, image, dir, and previous commands you used!

- `ctrl + r` -> search for previous commands
- `ctrl + t` -> search for files

## Tmux

this is a terminal tool that lets you have multiple parts to a terminal!

- `cmnd + s` -> this is the prefix to start entering tmux commands! add this before every tmux command
- `prefix + prefix` -> save the current tmux layout and applications
- `prefix + ctrl +r` -> reload the saved layout
- `prefix+o` -> open the menu for all sessions
- `prefix + %` -> open a new terminal to the right
- `prefix + "` -> open a new terminal bellow

# Things left to do

- fix zshrc to fit your need
- btop was not space
- some text modification on neofetch
- remove a bunch of stuff from nvim that you don't need
- go through a session where I explain how everything fits together and go through keyboard shortcuts
- install yazi
- cava is also nice? if you listen to music on your mac
- install luarocks

> [!WARNING]
> for advance use, I use hyprland which is great, but its difficult to use at the beginning.
> let me know when you get used to this stuff and we can see if you want to switch to it later!
