# Computer Coaching review

Here is a review on what we covered today:

## Tools (Apps)

- Word -> used to write your assignments and Documents
- Excel -> used to manage prices and keep tab on things
- Power point -> Used to make slides for demonstration
- power toys -> a windows tool kit that provides: _search functionality, color selection, key remapping_ and more
- File Explorer -> this is what you use to find all your files
- Task bar -> add application that you use often here by **_Pin to task bar_** option. (remember to keep ones you used often left side)

## Shortcuts

- alt + tab -> switch between application
- win + tab -> see all applications that are open
- ctrl + w -> close
- ctrl + t -> open a new tab (browser and file explorer)
- win + arrow keys -> split the screen to see multiple applications
- win + ctrl + arrow keys -> switch between virtual desktops (the thing we used to separate work and YouTube)

## Useful web info

- click on the star on the side of the url link to save a site (book marking)
- add extensions (extra browser functionality) by clicking on the puzzle piece at the top right
- use **_Keybr_** to learn touch typing(typing on keyboard without looking) -> [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)

## Brightspace

- notifications can be set by going to profile(at top right)=>notifications
- once inside a course, content is where all your materials are
- all assignments are under activities
- course information is a useful section to see what you will cover for the course and if you need to get any books
- tools is where you will find the zoom class room link
